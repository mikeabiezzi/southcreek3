Policy Regarding Damage Claims - May 20, 1992

In response to the fact that the Association has become involved in several recent instances in which damage to a downstairs condo has resulted from a problem with the plumbing in an upstairs condo, the Board has reviewed the language in the Declaration of Covenants regarding such situations and adopted the following policy:

1. The Declarations specifically state (Page 8, Article 4.03) that it is the responsibility of each condo owner to maintain at his own expense “all fixtures and equipment installed within the unit commencing at a point where the utilities enter the unit.”
2. If water leaking from within one condo causes damage to another condo, then the owner of the offending condo will be held responsible for the cost of repairs of restoration to the damaged condo.

For administrative purposes the following procedure will be followed when such conditions are reported:

1. If the damage is ongoing, the Manager will take those steps necessary (as outlined in Declaration Article 4.01) to enter the offending condo and limit the damage. Any damage to the offending condo, which is caused by this emergency effort, will be repaired at Association expense (Article 4.02).
1. The Manager will then attempt to contact the owners of the condos involved and make arrangements for cleanup and repair efforts. During these discussions, a copy of this policy should be given to each party involved and it should be explained that the HOA's insurance will cover the cost of any damage over the $250 deductible, but that repair cost for any damage under this amount will be the responsibility of the owner of the offending condo. Where possible, the owners will determine between them the need for repairs and make the necessary selection of contractors to perform the repairs.
1. It is important to note that while the offending condo's owner may have a voice in selection of contractors and in minimizing the cost of repairs, the repairs must be performed to the satisfaction of the damaged condo's owner.
1. In the event that the owner of the offending condo is unavailable or uncooperative, the Manager will make arrangements with contractors to perform the repairs, and will minimize cost of repairs where possible. The Association will pay the contractors involved and will add the amount of any such payments to the account of the owner of the offending condo.
1. In the absence of payment of these charges by the owner of the offending condo, the Manager will take such legal steps as are available and necessary (also defined by the Declarations) to collect such charges.

## <a name="accumulation-and disposal of trash"></a>Accumulation and Disposal of Trash 

Trash, Recyclables, Compostables and large or hazardous items must be properly disposed of, in a timely manner, in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community. Proper disposal prevents conditions that may create fire, health or safety hazards; and does not harbor pests or impair the aesthetic appearance of the community. General storage of items not designed or intended for outdoor use could constitute a violation. Items may include but are not limited to mattresses; discarded furniture and appliances; car parts and tires; wood pallets; and piled yard or food waste. However, every property and situation is unique and may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. (As defined by Boulder Code Enforcement)

[^ back to top](#)

## <a name="individual-property"></a>Individual Property

Individual Property (Proposed)
Interior space, including all drywall and finishings within each unit are under the individual control of the unit owner. However, all structural components and building features (including but not limited to studs, joists and internal construction of the building) are common property and cannot be accessed or changed by an individual or within an individual property.

[^ back to top](#)

## <a name="common-property"></a>Common Property

Common Property (Proposed)
All areas of the property that are commonly owned and jointly contribute to the property value of the association as a whole. This includes but is not limited to all parking lots, landscaped areas, walkways, fire access, dumpster areas and all exterior and structural components of all buildings. Owners and residents are not permitted to make any changes to Common Property as they would affect all owners in the association. Some changes may be considered if presented to the Board through an Architectural Review Request (e.g., changing paver stones, repairing concrete). Residents may not change any landscaping with the addition or removal of any plants, stones or landscaping materials. Around each building is a 2’ stone perimeter, to meet building codes, prevent pest infestations, avoid damage to buildings and siding and drain water away from building crawlspaces and foundations. These stones cannot be removed or replaced. However, residents are permitted to donate above ground landscape features, that are aesthetically appropriate, do not cause any damage and are easily removable (e.g., garden bench, terracotta or glazed planters, plant stands, sealed bottom, raised bed planters...). Note that any items placed in a common space will immediately be considered a donation to the association. All donations can be removed at any time, without notice, if any board member assesses the item to be inappropriate in aesthetic nature or placement. Some areas of common property are designated for limited use so check guidelines for ‘limited common property’.

[^ back to top](#)

## <a name="limited common-property"></a>Limited Common Property

Limited common property is defined as spaces commonly owned by the association, but designated for use by an individual or limited group of owners. Every unit in SC3 is allotted a limited common space, with a perimeter bound by the original construction of the outside fence and the exterior surface of the building, designated as a ‘fenced yard.’ Owners and residents have discretionary use of the fenced yard designated as the limited common element for the given unit. However, within the fenced yard, no items may be invasively attached to the exterior of the building (no nails or screws) and no siding may be cut or damaged. Owners are free to change landscaping within their fenced yard but may not change, adjust or modify any structural retaining walls that are present for the common good. Man-made features may be no taller than 70” total or 24” taller than the approved 46” fence. Man-made features can only be attached to the fence at the owner's discretion. All landscaping, repairs, maintenance and costs associated with the limited common space is the sole responsibility of the owner. Any item within a fenced yard that is in violation of common elements (e.g., shelf screwed to the wall, nails in siding, pet door through wall) may be removed without notice at the board's discretion and all associated expenses will be the owner's sole responsibility.

## <a name="swamp coolers-and dryer installation/venting"></a>Swamp Coolers and Dryer Installation/Venting

All are acceptable, at the owner's discretion. All, if any, must be installed exclusively inside an individual unit or fenced yard. None of these appliances, supports, wiring, hoses or other connections may be attached to the building exterior and no vents or exhausts may be installed within walls, floors, crawl spaces, attics or cut through building siding. Any of these violations may be corrected at any time without notice, at the board's discretion and all associated expenses will be the owner's sole responsibility.

[^ back to top](#)

## <a name="window and door repairs-and replacements"></a>Window and Door Repairs and Replacements 

Repair and replacement of windows and doors are periodically necessary and are the responsibility of the unit owner. However, any repairs and replacements must be submitted to the board through an ARR and be in compliance with all of the following guidelines: All window and door frames must match the natural tones of the building or be painted to match. Size, shape and dimensions of doors and windows cannot be changed, moved or in any way alter the installed position within the building. Windows (including those on unit doors and storm doors) must be filled with a single pane of glass to maintain aesthetic cohesion with the property as a whole.

[^ back to top](#)

## <a name="Exterior Colors-and Paint"></a>Exterior Colors and Paint

All exterior surfaces are subject to oversight by the board to assure aesthetic cohesion throughout the property. If paint is needed for a common area (e.g., the trim on a garage) it will be supplied, by request through the property manager at Hast & Co. If paint is needed for a limited common area (e.g., a white door or window) you or your contractor can get the paint directly from Sherwin Williams.

Paint: Sherwin Williams 

Finish: Solosatin Exterior 

Base Color: Sensational Sand 

Trim color: Sable

## <a name="pets-on property"></a>Pets on Property

There are many pets on the property, in addition to wildlife. Pets are the sole responsibility of their owner and must not disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the community. Owners are responsible for maintaining control of their pets at all times to prevent barking noise, avoid animals wandering unattended, at­large and pick­up all feces.

[^ back to top](#)

## <a name="pet-doors"></a>Pet Doors

Can be installed through the front door and/or storm door of a unit, at the owner's discretion but must comply with all guidelines regarding limited and common space. Pet doors cannot be installed through any common or exterior wall.

[^ back to top](#)

## <a name="pet waste-disposal"></a>Pet Waste Disposal

Pet waste disposal must be handled appropriately. Pet waste on common property must be picked up and properly disposed of, immediately. In addition to trash dumpsters in North and South waste collection areas, there are also 2 (soon 3) dog stations on the property at the Northeast, Southeast and Central corners of the property, along the property fence between SC3 and Bixby School. These stations have been recently replaced and are emptied regularly. SC3 will not stock bags but any extra plastic bags can be deposited or retrieved in the plastic bag dispensers to be reused for the disposal of pet waste.

[^ back to top](#)

## <a name="grills, fire pits-and open flames"></a>Grills, Fire Pits and Open Flames

According to Boulder City and County Fire Codes, all open flames, fire pits and standard grills (gas or charcoal) are illegal on SC3 property. These items constitute a significant fire hazard. Fire pits, tiki torches and charcoal grills (or other charcoal cookers) can be stored but cannot be used on SC3 property at any time. Grills that rely on gas canisters of 2lbs or smaller (small, green camping canisters) are the only acceptable form of grill, flame or incendiary cooker for exterior use in common or limited common areas. Any hazardous items (white, 20lbs. gas tanks) may be removed at any time, without notice, at the board's discretion. All associated expenses are the owner's sole responsibility.

[^ back to top](#)

## <a name="attic-and crawl spaces"></a>Attic and Crawl Spaces 

Attic and crawl spaces are restricted common areas. They are essential elements of all buildings and are integral to each building's structural integrity. No owners or residents may access attic or crawl spaces at any time for storage or improvement. For the purpose of inspections, SC3 board may ask a designated representative or professional to access attic or crawl spaces, which may then be subject to repair, as supervised by the board. Attic and crawl spaces may not be used by any owner for storage or access to extra space. Nor shall any owner or resident block access to any attic or crawl space.
